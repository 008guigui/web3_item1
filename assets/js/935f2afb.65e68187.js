If this sounds like something you would like however, you may also want to apply to Parity\'s Substrate Builders Program, which provides hands-on technical, ecosystem and strategical long-term support and access to extensive resources. You can find general documentation and more information on Substrate on the Substrate Developer Hub, and we encourage you to join the community in order to get help with specific issues or to stay up to date with the most recent developments.","sidebar":"docs"},"Introduction/team":{"id":"Introduction/team","title":"Team","description":"W3F Grants Committee","sidebar":"docs"},"maintenance":{"id":"maintenance","title":"Maintenance Grants","description":"Maintenance Grants are yet another idea to get involved with the Polkadot community.

This also applies in case of significant delays.","sidebar":"docs"},"Process/how-to-apply":{"id":"Process/how-to-apply","title":"1.
